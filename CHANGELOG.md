## 0.0.4 - 15.05.2020
- Homepage, Repository and Issuetracker updated to GitLab ones.
### Android
- Added some log messages to make easier to track errors.
- Class names minified/obfuscated by Android release mode were preventing get the correct class of the needed view for take the screenshot. Fixed comparing classes instead names. ivanjpg/native_screenshot#2 

## 0.0.3
* Homepage, Repository and Issuetracker added to `pubspec.yaml`.
### iOS
* Code improvement.
* The function now takes the screenshot, save it to the application directory and then it adds to the PhotoLibrary. Now it needs `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` key into `info.plist` file.

## 0.0.2
* Description added to `pubspec.yaml`.
* Documentation API done.
* Added licence.
* `README.md` updated

### Android
* Unified the code to condesate the plugin initialization and use for the v1 and v2 Flutter's plugin engine.
* Now the screenshot is written to a folder with the application name on it, if fails then goes to external storage.
* Tried `Canvas` and `PixelCopy` approaches, both throws a black image, still uses `getBitmap()` method.

## 0.0.1
### iOS
* Basic functionionality done.

### Android
* Tries to request permission if possible and considers `PixelCopy` (_API >= 26_) that still not works; `getBitmap()` works, so this is used for now.
